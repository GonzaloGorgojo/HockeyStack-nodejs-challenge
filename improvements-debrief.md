<h1> Suggested Project Improvements: </h1>

1. **Code Quality and Readability**:

   Refactor the codebase to improve code quality by breaking up long functions into smaller, more modular functions with clear responsibilities, and transform repetitive logic (e.g., retry/pagination) into reusable utility functions to reduce duplication. Improve error handling and logging to make it easier to debug issues. Introduce TypeScript to enhance type safety and readability, ensuring clear interfaces and reducing runtime errors. Finally, add unit tests, particularly for critical modules like API interactions and data processing, to ensure code quality and catch potential issues early.

2. **Project Architecture**:

   Restructure the project architecture by separating concerns into distinct modules (data access, business logic, API integration) and evaluate implementing a queueing system like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka to enhance data processing scalability and reliability.

3. **Code Performance**:
   Explore the posibility to use caching mechanisms to avoid redundant API calls, particularly for data that is unlikely to change frequently.
   Implement streaming to reduce memory consumption.
